# Network Speed

## Description

This script calculates the fastest connection for a device in a 2D grid 
populated with network nodes. This assignment was given to me in connection 
of my job application. Due to this fact, I wasn't sure if I should prioritize
code execution speed or showcase clean & maintainable code. In the end I decided
to include 2 files, 1 normal script and the other prioritizing speed over maintainability.
