# Network Speed

## Description

This script calculates the fastest connection for a device in a 2D grid 
populated with network nodes. This assignment was given to me in connection 
of my job application. Due to this fact, I wasn't sure if I should prioritize
code execution speed or showcase clean & maintainable code. In the end I decided
to prioritize readability over speed.

When making this assignment I realized that there is no real need to use
anything besides pure JavaScript; Anything else would've been fancy bloat. So
I ended up making the entire thing without using any 3rd party libraries

## Usage
I decided not to include any commandline arguments as I thought **using** commandline
arguments would ultimately be harder than editing the hard values at the top of the file.

The code can be executed by node with:
```
node run.js
```
Alternatively -- due to the code being pure JavaScript -- you can also
copy & paste the entire code into webconsole (or anything
else that runs JavaScript) and it will work
